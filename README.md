Welcome to the **Interactive Chess Board Web Application**, the front-end companion to a smart physical chessboard project. This interface allows users to interact with chess games in real-time, visualize legal moves, and integrate seamlessly with the physical hardware.

## Project Overview

The web application enhances chess gameplay by:
- Displaying the current state of the physical board
- Highlighting legal moves and opponent actions
- Showing game-end states (checkmate, stalemate, etc.)
- Providing a responsive interface accessible across platforms

This project is built with a modern, flexible tech stack focused on interactivity, real-time updates, and sleek design.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** – Cross-platform development
- **Expo** – Easy development and deployment environment for React Native apps
- **TypeScript** – Static typing for safer, more maintainable code
- **Three.js** – 3D visualizations (used for rendering the board or pieces if applicable)
- **Bootstrap** – Clean, responsive UI styling

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/icb-web-app.git
cd ./ICB-Web-Application
npm install
npx expo start
```

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **Expo CLI** installed.
